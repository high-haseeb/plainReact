# plainReact

i want to recreate react to try to understand how it works.
i am still learning github so it might not be the best thing you see today.

## Transpiler

a transpiler is like a compiler but it does not change the level of the code.
Babelon is a transpiler that transpiles(fancy compilation) jsx to vanilla-js.
